# 4. Definition of Algorithm Analysis and Examples

## Definition of Algorithm Analysis

* Analyzing an algorithm
  * Estimating the resources that the algorithm require
    * Memory
    * Communication bandwidth
    * Computational time \(the most important resource in the most of cases\)
* Factors affecting the running time
  * Computer used for executions
  * Algorithms
  * Data Structures
  * Input data size
* After analyzing the algorithms
  * We estimate the worst-case of the costs by the factors
    * i.e., Computational time by input data size
    * i.e., Iterations by inpt data size

## Simple Algorithm Analysis

```python
def calculateSum(intFrom, intTo):
    intSum = 0
    
    for i in range(intFrom, intTo):
        intSum += i
        
    return intSum
    
print(calculateSum(0, 10))
```

* Line 2: 1 iteration
* Line 4, 5:
  * \(intTo - intFrom\) iterations \* 2 lines 
  * = N iterations \* 2 lines
  * = 2N iterations
* Line 7: 1 iteration
* Total number of iterations = 2N + 2 iterations = O\(N\)

## Bubble Sort Algorithm Analysis

```python
def performBubbleSort(lst):
    for i1 in range(0, len(lst)):
        for i2 in range(i1 + 1, len(lst)):
            if lst[i1] < lst[i2]:
                lst[i1], lst[i2] = lst[i2], lst[i1]
    return lst
```

* Line 2: N iterations
* Line 3, 4, 5: N - i iterations \(i is from 0 to N - 1\) \* 3 lines
  * 1 to N, 2 to N, . . ., N - 1 to N
  * In other words, $$\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N-1}1$$ iterations \* 3 lines
  * Assuming that "if" always results in true \(i.e., worst case\)
* Line 5: 1 iteration
* Total number of iterations = $$\frac{n(n-1)}{2} * 3 + N + 1$$ 
* $$= \frac{3}{2}n^2-\frac{3}{2}n + n + 1$$ iterations
* $$= O(N^2)$$
