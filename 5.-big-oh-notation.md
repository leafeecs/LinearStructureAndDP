# 5. Big-Oh Notation

## Asymptotic Notation: Big-Oh

* What do O\(N\) and O\(N²\) mean?
* That's the Big-Oh notation
  * Notation to show the worst-case running time
    * Do you remember?
      * Assuming that "if" always results in True
      * So, this is a worst scenario for the run-time
        * Because the program should run the statements in the "if" blocks
* Definition of the Big-Oh Notations
  * f\(N\) = O\(g\(N\)\)
  * There are positive constants c and n₀ such that 
    * f\(N\) ≤ c∙g\(N\) when N ≥ n₀
  * The growth rate of f\(N\) is less than or equal to the growth rate of g\(N\)
  * g\(N\) is an upper bound on f\(N\)
