# 3. Importance of Efficiency

## Why Do We Care About Efficiency?

* Writing a working program is not good enough 
  * The program could be inefficient
  * If the program runs on a large data, the running time becomes a big issue
    * Sometimes, a program may not be usable because of the efficiency
    * Imagine a transaction system of a financial company
      * 1 transaction = 0.001 second
      * 10 transactions by 10,000 account holders = 100 seconds
      * Side Effect
        * If there is no reaction from the system, the users click the request again!
        * Increased requests when there is a delay
    * Imagine a bubble sorting function for bank accounts
      * 10,000 accounts â†’ roughly 50,000,000 iterations for sorting
* Therefore, we need a guarantee of the worst-case scenario
  * The worst-case running time of a single transaction
  * The worst-case transaction request numbers of a single day
